# react_next_file_browser
simple file browser with react, node, next.js, async functions to access file system. Note I used a timer so that on a path change we only fire one request to the server to get the file contents.

Quite a lot more can be done with this. So far its uses a search bar to search directories. The directory contents are display in a panel. If user clicks the file / directory it will either display the contents or go into the directory.
